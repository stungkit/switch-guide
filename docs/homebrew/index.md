## Terminology

Homebrew is a general term, the term can be used for Homebrew apps (`.nro` files) or in the form of background processes, called "sysmodules". The Switch natively has sysmodules built into its firmware but you can run additional Homebrew sysmodules that can add functionality to your Switch. In the section below, you can find additional and commonly used Homebrew apps and sysmodules.

Homebrew apps are stored in `sd:/switch` by default and Homebrew sysmodules are stored in `sd:/atmosphere/contents` by default.
